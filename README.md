## Ideas for Further Products



* A page or embeddable widget that returns the most recent photos from all registered Flickr accounts.  
* A page or embeddable widget that returns the most recent videos from all registered YouTube accounts.  
* A page or embeddable widget that returns the most recent posts from all registered Facebook accounts.  
* A page or embeddable widget that returns the most recent tweets from all registered Twitter accounts.  

Even more powerful options include a more complex Kayak.com-esque filtering experience with perhaps one set of checkboxes that allow checking/unchecking which agencies and/or services and/or topics and/or service specific actions are filterable.  

* A http://ada.mbecker.cc/USAxGITHUB/-like interface across all of the above.
* A http://ada.mbecker.cc/USAxGITHUB/-like interface for just any one of the services (e.g., just twitter, facebook, or youtube).


* A dashboard that shows, for all agencies (or a set list), how many such accounts they have for each service.  E.g.  USDA has 7 youtube accounts, 3 flickr accounts, etc.  The number should then link to the appropriate page that links to each of them  See example.
 * [Early alpha](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq4b5kJzVK5adGdLSlZuejFYa1IwdzZpZG5mYll3a2c#gid=0)

* A dashboard that shows recent activity per service, per agency (e.g. USDA has uploaded a 3 youtube videos, 11 photos, etc).  Best to offer different time frames, either as individual products or as a feature that allows toggling between (e.g.) today, last 7 days, and last 30 days.  See example.

Notes: 
--For #4, if it is possible to have this dynamic such that new tweets are added live or in a similar fashion to twitter.com (‘3 new tweets’), that would be significant. 
--For #1-4, an alternative version could include all service-specific activity instead of just the activities listed (e.g. likes, follows, retweets, etc).  
--Think about the ability to allow agencies (or citizens) to re-use with ease - e.g. forking a github repo and making just a few edits; or even making it simpler than that.  For instance, note the iframe model used at http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy/ via http://goo.gl/bzHH2 (code- http://goo.gl/StAvQ).  Just by customizing the url, another agency could easily consume this same instance.
